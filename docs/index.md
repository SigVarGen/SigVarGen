# SigVarGen Documentation

Welcome to the documentation site for **SigVarGen**, a Python-based framework designed for generating and augmenting synthetic signals with realistic variations, interruptions, and noise profiles.

This framework designed to create **multiple variants** of a base **1D signal** under the same environmental conditions. It allows the simulation of both **idle-state signals** and signals affected by **external perturbations**, enabling robust testing of algorithms in dynamic environments based on multiple measurements of the same event. Framework is suitable for **time-series analysis**, **signal processing**, and **synthetic data generation** in various domains such as sensor data modeling, embedded systems testing, and machine learning augmentation.
